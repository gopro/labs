## GoPro Reframe

FX Reframe is the ultimate GoPro image reframing tool, while it is marketed for it use with 360 cameras, 
it is just as useful for reframing any GoPro source footage. GoPro's own media team uses this filter 
on a large percentage of video produced (it is part of the GoPro secret source.)

The current release version of the tools is posted [within our community pages](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-FX-Reframe) and 
it also free with Adobe's Marketplace under plugins. 

There is also [beta version for DaVinci Resolve](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Reframe-For-DaVinci-Resolve).
