# GoPro Labs Command Language

## Setting Commands

All QR Codes are simple text strings, alphanumeric characters to describe settings and actions for your GoPro camera. It is fairly easy to learn, 
so you can create you own custom commands. Here is an example command to set video at 4K 60fps with some Protune customization: **mVr4p60x-.5cFw55**. 
Breaking-down how that command works, firstly all GoPro QR settings commands are separated with lowercase characters, so this command is interpreted 
in these groups mV r4 p60 x-.5 cF w55. This is what each command group means:

* **mV** - is shorthand for mode Video - this is the same a swiping the camera to use video mode.
* **r4** - set resolution to 4K (16:9), r4T (for 4K 4:3) and r4X (for HERO11/12s 8:7) 
* **p60** - set the frame rate to 60 fps 
* **x-.5** - exposure compensation is set to -0.5
* **cF** - color Flat
* **w55** - white balance to 5500K
  
Any of these can be used on their own, or in a different order, however the order can have meaning. If the camera was currently in a photo mode, 
and you set the Protunes settings first, then switched to video, any Protune changes would be to the photo preset, the video will have whatever Protune 
settings you had previously. The individual commands within a QR code are performed in order, just like you would when using the touchscreen.

## Option Commands

Just like settings, these alter camera options, not the settings used in a preset. Examples like beep volume and screen brightness. It turns out there are a lot of these. 
While each setting command is a single lowercase character, it can be followed by a number of either uppercase or numbers for the parameters. Option commands, starting with **o** 
can stack many parameter in one command. This is a single options command **oV1B4D2** which translates to Volume - 10%, Brightness 40%, and LEDs rear only. The same command can be 
written as **oV1oB4oD2**, three separate option commands, but as storage in a QR code is limited so options can be stacked for more efficiency, this is also why spaces are not 
used between commands.

## The Full List of Settings and Option Commands

### Mode commands: 
 * **mV** - mode Video
 * **mVL** - mode Video Looping (\*)
 * **mP** - mode Photo
 * **mT** - mode Timelapse video (\*\*)
 * **mTP** - mode Timelapse Photo (\*\*)
 * **mTW** - mode TimeWarp
 * **mPB** - mode Photo Burst 
 * **mPN** - mode Photo Night
 * **mNL** - mode Night-Lapse Video (\*\*)
 * **mNP** - mode Night-Lapse Photo (\*\*)
 * **mL** - mode Live-Burst Photo (HERO10 only)
 * **mST** - mode Star Trails (HERO11/12 only)
 * **mLP** - mode Light Painting (HERO11/12 only)
 * **mLT** - mode Vehicle Lights (HERO11/12 only)
 
<b>\* Video Looping:</b> You need to create this preset on camera, before this command will select it.<br>
<b>\*\* Time/Night-Lapse modes:</b> The camera defaults to having presets for only one time-lapse mode and one night-lapse mode, yet both modes have two configurations (video or photo.) For all QR Code mode commands to work, a preset is needed for every mode you wish to use. e.g. If you only have a preset for night-lapse video (NLV), the QR command for NLV will work, but will not for night-lapse photo (NLP). To solve this, create a new preset for NLP, and both video and photo night-lapse commands will work.

## Action and Conditional Commands
Now you know how to set up your camera with QR commands, the fun really begins with Actions and Conditionals. Actions are starting **!S** or ending a capture **!E**, manual upload **!U**, 
beginning a live stream **!G**. As these actions are typically just pressing a button or camera menu, these actions can be enhanced based on time. e.g. **!08:00S**, which will sleep 
the camera until 8am, and then start capture (in the camera's default mode.) We can also do an conditional capture based on time. e.g. **>06:00<19:00mV~mNL!S** with this command, if the 
time is greater than 6am and less than 7pm, set mode Video, else set mode NightLaspe, then start.  You can start pre-programming actions with QR codes.

### The Full List of Actions
* **!**time**S** - Start at exactly **time** if in hh:mm form, or after n seconds. 
* **!**time**SQ** - Start Quickly at approximately **time** if in hh:mm form, or after n seconds.  
* **!**time**E** - End at **time** if in hh:mm form, or after n seconds.

* **!**time**Rx** - <sup>H11-12</sup> Repeat the command starting at position x (i.e. a goto command).
* **!**time**N** - No Action until exact **time**, useful if you just need a pause.
* **!**time**NQ** - No Action until at approximately **time**.
* **!**time**O** - Off, shutdown the camera.

### Storing metadata (Permanent, survives power off)
#### Old style (firmware released before March, '24)
* **!M**fourcc**=<courier>"string"</courier>**
* **!M**fourcc**=Number metadata** (comma separated)

#### New style (after March, '24)
* **\***fourcc**=<courier>"string"</courier>**
* **\***fourcc**=Number metadata**  (comma separated)

#### Example for display the owner’s name
**\*OWNR=<courier>"Joe Bloggs"</courier>**

Note: All strings must use <courier>"</courier> (ASCII 34) and not the <courier>”</courier> (148) character.  

All tags between **OWNA** and **OWNZ** will be displayed and stored in **GoPro-owner.txt**.

All tags between **OWNa** and **OWNz** will be only stored in the **GoPro-owner.txt**

Any four character code can be used for store other information. You can also store numeric data examples: 
* **\*CAMR=53** - metadata CAMR will be 53 
* **\*ABCD=45.234** - metadata ABCD will be floating point 45.234
* **\*UNIT=-1723** - metadata UNIT will be -1723

## Macro support (since March, '24)
Added support for macros, or crude scripting subroutines. This expands the potential complexity for QR scripting, as the entire script is no longer limited to 255 characters. 
It would be possible to run scripts nearing ~1.2KB. Note: recursion is supported, macros can call other macros, and can call themselves.

Macros are saved in string FourCCs:
* **$**fourcc**&#61;<courier>"custom Labs commands"</courier>**  (temporary)
* **\***fourcc**&#61;<courier>"custom Labs commands"</courier>**  (permanent)

Example: This macro calculates the Light Value and stores the result in variable **E**<br>
**\*LVAL=**<courier>"=Ii=Ss=I/100=S/I=E6.25=E*S=E#2"</courier>

 e.g. *SUBA="mVr4p60'60p'!S!2E!1N" Note: Use single quotes for text within double quotes.

In a separate QR Code will call LVAL and display the result<br>
**^LVAL**<courier>"Current LV $E"</courier>

Note: for Macros that print output use single quotes for text within.
**\*DPLV=**<courier>"^LVAL'current LV $E'"</courier>


## Reset Actions ##

* **!RESET!1OR** - erase all your permanent metadata (anything that used !Mxxxx command.) Then Reboot.  (requires user confirmation.)
* **!FORMAT**<sup>H10-12</sup> - for SD formatting via QR Code (requires user confirmation.)
* **!FRESET**<sup>H10-12</sup> - Factory reset, erase everything, except QR code metadata (requires user confirmation.)
* **!PRESET**<sup>H10-12</sup> - Presets reset, restore the default presets (requires user confirmation.)
* **!WRESET**<sup>H10-12</sup> - WiFi Credentials reset, erase all your BLE and WiFi configurations (requires user confirmation.)

## Scripting

The geek factor is highest in this section.  This is close to a Turing-complete language, you can get many interesting capture control jobs done.  There are save and load commands, additive metadata and clock time conditionals

* **!SAVEname=script**  e.g. !SAVEdaily=dPmP!12:00S!Ldaily - a save script called ‘daily’ that repeatedly shots one photo every day at noon. 
* **!Lname**  e.g. !LnightLapse - load and run a script called nightLapse
* **<courier>"any text"</courier>** e.g. mV<courier>"Video Mode"</courier>!S!5E!4NmP<courier>"Photo Mode"</courier>!S!5R - this will display <courier>"Video Mode"<courier> and <courier>"Photo Mode"</courier> when switch to those modes.  

### Conditionals Based on Time

**\<** , **>** and **==** characters are used to indicate a conditional: less than, greater than equal, and equal (**==** Since March 2024 firmware)

**\<08:45!S** is equivalent to 

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Start

**>18:30!R** is equivalent to 

> if(current_time >= 18:30) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Repeat

**==10:10!R** is equivalent to
> if(current_time == 10:10) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Repeat


The if condition defaults to effecting only the one command after the condition

**\<08:45!S<courier>"Hello World"</courier>** is equivalent to:

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Start<br>
> print <courier>"Hello World"</courier>
	
The start will happen if the condition is true, but the print message occurs whether true or false.  To make the print also part of the true state you can use **+** between the joined commands.

**\<08:45!S+<courier>"Hello World"</courier>** is equivalent to

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Start <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    print <courier>"Hello World"</courier> <br>
> }

These can be stacked too, e.g. **\<08:45!S+<courier>"Hello World"</courier>+!60E** is equivalent to

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Start <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    print <courier>"Hello World"</courier> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    After 60 seconds End the capture <br>
> }

Conditions support **else** statements using the **~** character after the last 'true' command

**\<08:45!S+<courier>"Hello World"</courier>+!60E~!08:44N!R** is equivalent to

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Start <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    print <courier>"Hello World"</courier> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    After 60 seconds End the capture <br>
> }<br>
> else<br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Sleep until 8:44 the next day <br>
> }<br>
> Repeat


Conditionals themselves can be stacked like **\>09:15<10:00!S** is equivalent to 

> if(current_time >= 9:15) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(current_time <= 10:00) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start<br>
	
However the else can only be applied to the last condition. **\>09:15<10:00!S+<courier>"Hello World"</courier>+!60E~!09:30N!R** is equivalent to

> if(current_time >= 9:15) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	if(current_time <= 10:00) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	{<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Start<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		print <courier>"Hello World"</courier><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		After 60 seconds End the capture<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	else<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	{<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Sleep until 9:30 the next day<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}<br>
> }<br>
> Repeat

The command language is kept simple, so it doesn't maintain a stack on the conditional nesting. 

### Conditionals Based on Camera Status (HERO11 & 12)

New conditional commands for 2023. Now \>xValue and/or \<xValue and/or ==xValue can be used to test camera states, where 'x' is the camera state to test, and Value the amount to test against:<br>
* **a** accelerationValue - **\>aValue**CMD if(acceleration \> Value) then CMD, units in Gs
* **b** batteryLevel - **\>bValue**CMD if(battery \> Value) then CMD, units in percentage
* **b:T** batteryTemperature - **\>bValue**CMD if(battery \> Value) then CMD, units in degrees C
* **c** coordDistance - **\>cDist**CMD  then CMD, units in meters, compare distance from initial GPS location
* **c:X** coord[A-Z]Distance - **\>c:XDist**CMD There are up to 26 pre-stored GPS locations oMFRMA=latt,long thru oMFRMZ. If nothing is store in FRMx, it will initialize with the current location. Reset a location with $FRMx=0,0 it will reinit with the current location.
* **d** GPS DOP - **\<dValue**CMD - if(DOP \< Value) then CMD, units in 100x DOP. GPS location precision.
* **e** random - **\<eValue**CMD \<e50 - 50% true \<e90 - 90% true.
* **g** gyroValue - **\>gValue**CMD if(gryo \> Value) CMD, numbers are in degrees per second.
* **h** heightValue - **\>hValue**CMD if(height \> Value) CMD, numbers are in meters above sealevel.
* **i** isoValue - **\>iValue**CMD - testing ISO where ISO ranges from 100 to 6400
* **k** speedValue - **\>kValue**CMD if(gps Speed \> Value) CMD e.g. >k45!S, numbers are in km/h.
* **l** loop_countValue - **\<lValue**CMD if(loop_count \< Value) CMD e.g. \<l45!R, this is the loop count for !R repeat, since last QR scan or boot.
* **m** motionValue - **\<mValue**CMD if(motion \< Value) CMD Motion value is a percentage of pixels moving  e.g. >m5!S+60E!R, this look of motion greater than 5%, and record for 60seconds when detected.
* **m:X** motion[A-Z]Value - <m:A through <m:Z adjusts the sensitivity of the detector, the above is the equivalent <m:J.  'A' is very low sensitivity, only large pixel changes detected, 'Z' tiniest change detected. 
* **n** network Connect - if false it returns -1, otherwise it returns the string length of the SSID
* **n:L** networkLivestreaming - if false it returns -1, 1.0 if currently livestreaming
* **p** soundpressureValue - **\>pValue**CMD if(spl \> Value) CMD, numbers are in dB
* **p:T** processorTempValue - **\>pValue**CMD if(processorTemp \> Value) then CMD, units in degrees C
* **r** recording - **\>r0**CMD1~CMD2 if(Recording > 0) then CMD1 else CMD2 
* **r:C** remote Connected - **\>r:C0**CMD1~CMD2 if(RC_Connected) then CMD1 else CMD2 
* **r:A** remote App Connected - **\>r:A0**CMD1~CMD2 if(App_Connected) then CMD1 else CMD2 
* **s** shutterValue - **\>sValue**CMD - testing shutter, where 1/Value is used for shutter speed
* **t:X** timedate - **\>t:XValue**CMD - where X Y-Year M-Month D-Day H-Hour N-miNute S-second W-day_of_the_Week B-seconds_since_Boot Q-seconds_since_Qrcode R-recording_time W-day_of_week
* **u** USB power - **\>u0**CMD1~CMD2 if(power is on USB) then CMD1 else CMD2
* **v** Current Camera Mode - **==vValue**CMD video=12, TLV=13, Looping Video=15, Photo=16, Night Photo=18, Burst Photo=19, etc. Example: ==v12!S  will start recording video if in Video Mode. ==v16!S will take a photo if in Photo Mode.
* **y** mode_pressesValue - **\>y0**CMD1~CMD2 if(mode_presses > 0) then CMD1 else CMD2
* **z** shutter_pressesValue - **\>z0**CMD1~CMD2 if(shutter_presses > 0) then CMD1 else CMD2

### Assignments, Variables and Math

QR Command scripts can include variables and operation on them. Why? Fun maybe? More power, for sure! A complete program in a QR Code.

As 'a' to 'z' and system system fields, 'A' to 'Z' are the variable can contain any floating point number. This new variables are all initialized to zero, 
and can be tested with the '<' and '>' conditionals. To make them non-zero, they can be assign with and '=' command. Just like with conditions and action, 
the '=' character is the command delimiter and comes first.  

**=A5**  is the command variable A = 5.

**=P3.14159265** assigns Pi to variable P.  

Now math can be used to modify your variables.

* **=A+1.4** adds in form A = A + 1.4
* **=D-2** subtraction D = D - 2  (note: assignments of negative numbers aren't support, but subtracting is. So **=D0=D-2** would initialize D to be -2, although =D0 is unnecessary as all variable are initialize to zero at boot.)
* **=A*P** multiply A = A * P
* **=E&#47;7** divide E = E &#47; 7
* **=H^A** raised to a power H = H ^ A
* **=F^0.5** raised to a power F = sqrt(F)
* **=B%10** modulus  B = B % 10 
* **=G#2** Log base N  G = log(G)/log(2) 
* **=J&6** Bitwise AND like  J = (float)((int)J & 6) 
* **=K&#124;3** Bitwise OR K = (float)((int)K &#124; 3) 

There should be a prize if some can come up with a practical use for all of these ;)

So if thought the above is crazy, it gets weirder.

* **=B$BITR**  load the contents of the BITR (bitrate) hack into variable B, otherwise store zero.  So you can test if a feature is enabled.
* **=Tt:W** load the day of the week into variable T
* **=Di** load the current ISO value into variable D
* **$EVBS=E**  store the current into EV Bias hack, so you can make a variable mess with your exposure (potentially mid capture.)
* **\*VarC=C**  permanently store the current variable C into metadata field VarC, so this can be read back on next boot.  
* **!$AR**  delay an action (like !R) with a variable amount of time, e.g. this will loop forever, doubling the sleep time with each interaction **=A$VARA<A1=A1=A*2!MVARA=A!$AR**

### Why Add Math to QR codes

You the user can have very particular shooting needs, this improves the robustness of Labs to cover a wider range of automatic captures. And is it cool. ;)

Say you want use a GoPro as a crude light meter, and report the output as an [exposure value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value), then make capture decision based on that EV value.

EV = logbase2 (f-number^2/(time x gain_above_base_iso))  is the formula for EV<br>

As a QR command: **=E6.25=Gi=G&#42;0.01=E/G=E&#42;s=E#2<courier>"Exposure value $E"</courier>!R**<br>

Command steps explained:
> E=6.25<br>
> G=ISO value<br>
> G=G&#42;0.01<br>
> E=E/G<br>
> E=E&#42;shutter value (1/s)<br>
> E=log(E)/log(2)<br>
> print E<br>
> repeat<br>
