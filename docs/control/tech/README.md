# GoPro Labs Command Language

## Setting Commands

All QR Codes are simple text strings, alphanumeric characters to describe settings and actions for your GoPro camera. It is fairly easy to learn, 
so you can create you own custom commands. Here is an example command to set video at 4K 60fps with some Protune customization: `mVr4p60x-.5cFw55`. 
Breaking-down how that command works, firstly all GoPro QR settings commands are separated with lowercase characters, so this command is interpreted 
in these groups mV, r4, p60, x-.5, cF and then w55. No space or other delimiters are used. This is what each command group means:

* `mV` - is shorthand for mode Video - this is the same a swiping the camera to use video mode.
* `r4` - set resolution to 4K (16:9), r4T (for 4K 4:3) and r4X (for HERO11-13s 8:7) 
* `p60` - set the frame rate to 60 fps 
* `x-.5` - exposure compensation is set to -0.5
* `cF` - color Flat
* `w55` - white balance to 5500K
  
Any of these can be used on their own, or in a different order, however the order can have meaning. If the camera was currently in a photo mode, 
and you set the Protunes settings first, then switched to video, any Protune changes would be to the photo preset, the video will have whatever Protune 
settings you had previously. The individual commands within a QR code are performed in order, just like you would when change settings using the camera menus and touchscreen.

## Option Commands

Just like settings, these alter camera options, not the settings used in a preset. Examples like beep volume and screen brightness. It turns out there are a lot of these. 
While each setting command is a single lowercase character, it can be followed by a number of either uppercase or numbers for the parameters. Option commands, starting with `o` 
can stack many parameter in one command. This is a single options command `oV1B4D2` which translates to Volume - 10%, Brightness 40%, and LEDs rear only. The same command can be 
written as `oV1oB4oD2`, three separate option commands, but as storage in a QR code is limited so options can be stacked for more efficiency, this is also why spaces are not 
used between commands. The only places for using spaces is within quotes, like for preset names or printing messages to the screen.

## The Full List of Settings and Option Commands

### Mode commands: 
 * `mV` - mode Video
 * `mVL` - mode Video Looping (\*)
 * `mP` - mode Photo
 * `mT` - mode Timelapse video (\*\*)
 * `mTP` - mode Timelapse Photo (\*\*)
 * `mTW` - mode TimeWarp
 * `mPB` - mode Photo Burst 
 * `mPN` - mode Photo Night
 * `mNL` - mode Night-Lapse Video (\*\*)
 * `mNP` - mode Night-Lapse Photo (\*\*)
 * `mL` - mode Live-Burst Photo (HERO10 only)
 * `mST` - mode Star Trails (HERO11-13 only)
 * `mLP` - mode Light Painting (HERO11-13 only)
 * `mLT` - mode Vehicle Lights (HERO11-13 only)
 
<b>\* Video Looping:</b> You need to create this preset on camera, before this command will select it.<br>
<b>\*\* Time/Night-Lapse modes:</b> The camera defaults to having presets for only one time-lapse mode and one night-lapse mode, yet both modes have two configurations (video or photo.) For all QR Code mode commands to work, a preset is needed for every mode you wish to use. e.g. If you only have a preset for night-lapse video (NLV), the QR command for NLV will work, but will not for night-lapse photo (NLP). To solve this, create a new preset for NLP, and both video and photo night-lapse commands will work. Not all modes are available on every camera. 
 
### Defaults modes (on power up): 
 * `dL` - last used mode, the camera will boot up to last mode used before shutdown
 * `dV` - last used Video mode, the camera will boot into video mode

- "Current mode $v" - $v is one of the system variable (see below), v display the camera current mode.
- "Temperature\n $p:T C" - $p:T system variable for processor Temperature (see below), prints text "Temperature" on a new line value of the temp in C.

## Action and Conditional Commands
Now you know how to set up your camera with QR commands, the fun really begins with Actions and Conditionals. Actions are starting `!S` or ending a capture `!E`, manual upload `!U`, 
beginning a live stream `!G`. As these actions are typically just pressing a button or camera menu, these actions can be enhanced based on time. e.g. `!08:00S`, which will sleep 
the camera until 8am, and then start capture (in the camera's default mode.) We can also do an conditional capture based on time. e.g. `>06:00<19:00mV~mNL!S` with this command, if the 
time is greater than 6am and less than 7pm, set mode Video, else set mode NightLaspe, then start.  You can start pre-programming actions with QR codes.

### The Full List of Actions
* **!**time**Bx** - <sup>H11-13</sup> Beeps and Blinks, `!B` - Blink once, `!B0` - Beep once, `!B1` - Blink+Beep once, `!B2` - Blink+Beep twice
* **!**time**Cx** - <sup>H10-13</sup> Up to x GBs to make sure is clear on the SD card. e.g `!C16` - clears up to 16GB. If more than x is available, no files are removed. x is limited to half SD size. Deletes the oldest media first. 
* **!**time**C or CA-CZ** - <sup>H13</sup>Clear location distance for system variables c, c:A thru c:Z
* **!**time**Dx** - <sup>H10-11</sup> !Dx wait for GPS lock with a DOP less than x, then sync time. For time only locks `!D` is fine. For high precsion try `!D10` 
* **!**time**E** - End at <time> if in hh:mm form, or after n seconds. e.g. `!20:00E` - End at 8pm or `!120E` - End after 2 minutes (120s).

### Storing metadata (Permanent, survives power off)
#### Old style (old cameras up to HERO9, supported by all models)
* **!M**fourcc**=<courier>"string"</courier>**
* **!M**fourcc**=Number metadata** (comma separated)

#### New style (support HERO10 onward)
* **\***fourcc**=<courier>"string"</courier>**
* **\***fourcc**=Number metadata**  (comma separated)

#### Example for display the owner’s name
* `*OWNR="Joe Bloggs"`  - Within the quotes spaces are allowed.
* `*OWNR="Jill Bloggs\n(555)-252-5555"`  - the addition of "\n" allows for a new line.
* `*OWNS="Jill and Joes\n(555)-252-5555\njandj@yahoo.com"`  - multi-line example

Note: All strings must use <courier>"</courier> (ASCII 34) and not the <courier>”</courier> (148) character.  

All tags between **OWNA** and **OWNZ** will be displayed and stored in **GoPro-owner.txt**.

All tags between **OWNa** and **OWNz** will be only stored in the **GoPro-owner.txt**

Any four character code can be used for store other information. You can also store numeric data examples: 
* `*CAMR=53` - metadata CAMR will be 53 
* `*ABCD=45.234` - metadata ABCD will be floating point 45.234
* `*UNIT=-1723` - metadata UNIT will be -1723 
* `*LLTZ=32.707,-117.1576,-7` - set camera location (GPS off) with Latt/Long/TimeZone 

### Storing Temporarily Metadata (until power off)<br>
#### Old style (old cameras up to HERO9)
* **oM**fourcc**&#61;<courier>"string"</courier>**  
* **oM**fourcc**=Number metadata** (comma separated)

#### Storing Temporarily Metadata (New style - HERO10 onward)
* **$**fourcc**&#61;<courier>"string"</courier>**  
* **$**fourcc**=Number metadata** (comma separated)

Any four character code can be used for store other information. This data will be temporarily stored
* `$CAMA=53` - metadata CAMA will be 53 
* `$AAAA=45.234` - metadata ABCD will be floating point 45.234
* `$UNTS=-1723` - metadata UNIT will be -1723

All metadata in stored in a GPMF format with the MP4, 360 or JPG files, this is an open source, so if it free to integrated within any third party tool. 
The above global metadata can be extracted with this [**demo web tool**](../metadata)

### Some Four Character Codes are reserved for feature extensions
* **24HZ** 10-13: enable film standard 24.0 frame, rather than the default broadcast standard 23.976. The existing 24p mode(s) will have the new frame rate when this is enabled, all other video modes are unaffected. Input Data: 1-enable, 0-disable. e.g. `*24HZ=1`
* **64BT** H8-10/MAX: 12GB Chapter sizes on HERO8/9/10 and MAX cameras (default on H11 onward.) Note: Will not be active for QuickCaptures. Input Data: 1-enable, 0-disable WARNING: Larger chapters will not playback on camera or support USB transfers, but are compatible with desktop tools. Permanent required. e.g. `*64BT=1` for older cameras. For HERO11 or newer try `*64BT=64000` for 64GB chapters.
* **ARCH** H8-13/MAX: Archive mode: an ultra simplified video camera mode for novices documenting critical events, where you don’t want the camera mode modified. Either button will start and stop video capture. Input Data: 1-enable, 0-disable WARNING: only removable via the disable command. Permanent required. e.g. `*ARCH=1`
* **AUDS** H10-13: Audio Level: displays the current estimate of the sound pressure level in dB. Input Data: 1-enable, 0-disable. e.g. `$AUDS=1`
* **BASE** H8-10/MAX: Base file name change, adding to beginning of the filename. Input: H10-13 supports wildcards within [ ]: like [yyyy-mm-dd] or [HH-MM-SS]  e.g. A-[yyyymmddHHMMSS] WARNING: GoPro App and cloud will not support renamed files. e.g. `*BASE="CamA-[yy-mm-dd]"`
* **BERS** H10-13: Bypass ERS compensation, extremely rare usecases. Input Data: 0-display, 1-enable, 2-enable only with EIS off e.g. `*BERS=2`

* **BITR** H10-13: set the compression in Mb/s for the Protune High Bitrate setting. Normally this would be around 100Mb/s, however higher (or lower) rates may be achieved with newer SD Cards.Input Data: MB/s from 2 to 200. e.g. `*BITR=180`
* **BITH** H10-12: set the compression for LRVs in Mb/s. Normally this would be around 4Mb/s, however higher (or lower) rates may be achieved with newer SD Cards. Input Data: MB/s from 1 to 100. 
* **BITL** H11-13: controlling the livestream maximum bitrate (up to 8Mbit/s). Input Data: MB/s from 1 to 8.
* **BOOT** Boot command can be dangerous, but a safe way to use them is to store the script on the SD Card. So the boot command would be `*BOOT="!Lbt"` which attempts to load a file bt from the MISC folder of the SD card. So creating boot command should always use the formatting `*BOOT="!Lbt"!SAVEbt="your script"` e.g. `*BOOT="!Lbt"!SAVEbt=!12:00NmP!S!1R`
* **BURN** H8-13/MAX: Add date, time and other burn-in text to your video. Input Format (0,height)[yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SSaa] examples:   (0,30)Local Time: [HH:MMaa]   (0,26)Local Time: [HH:MM:SSAA]   (0,40)©[yyyy]\ XYZ Inc.   (0,24)Shoot Date [yy/mm/dd]

* **DAUD** H10-13: Disable Audio in video captures, all MP4 files will have no audio track. Application: high bit-rate drones video.Input Data: 1 to disable audio, 0 to re-enable
* **DBGL** Enables more debug logging. Labs saves it logs to the SD card under MISC/qrlog.txt. Using this extension increases the details and logged events. e.g. To see more logging from boot up use `*DBGL=1`
* **DIST** H13: Time-Lapse Video Distance, x is a GPS travel distance between exposures in meters, rather than time for an in-camera computed timelapse. So `$DIST=5` will set a 5 meter interval for TLV. One exception is when x=1, 10 meters will be used, 1 meter is too noisy (GPS errors.) So this feature is good for 2 meters of larger. For shorter distances or a higher speed, you the new TLV sample rate for 4Hz (p4), for the best distance precision. e.g. `mTr5Xp4$DIST=5`
* **DIVE** H12-13: Optimizing the Hypersmooth stabilization for underwater. It might be no surprise, but HyperSmooth is designed for the camera operation above the water's surface, underwater there is typically less camera shake, and HS is still 70% effective at removing shake. The hack adapts HS to use the refractive index (RI) of water (defaults to 1.335, good for fresh and command salt water), to remove closer to 100% of unwanted shake. Note: if you know your area's RI is significantly different, use DIVE=r, where r can be 1.3 to 1.45 is supported. e.g. `$DIVE=1` for most underwater captures. To create a dive preset use `mV$PRES="14,DIVE"mV`
* **DLRV** H10-11: Disable LRV file creation. Application: high bit-rate drones video. Input Data: 1 to disable LRVs, 0 to re-enable. e.g. `*DLRV=1` to permanently disable LRV files.

Input Data: Icon number 0 thru 32, preset name up to 15 characters. e.g. `$PRES="14,Scuba"` On HERO12 and 13, present name that use FourCC commands with enable those command only when the user selects that preset.  e.g. `$PRES="14,DIVE WBLK"` creates a preset called "DIVE WBLK" that enables the DIVE and WBLK extensions. Note: While oMPRES and $PRES are using "temporary" metadata style commands, the preset created is not temporary, it will remain until the user removes it.
* **PRXY** H10-13: Store LRV files as NLE ready proxies. Normally a camera will encode an LRV (Low Res Video) for every MP4, with this enabled LRVs are made MP4s within a subfolder. Input Data: 1-move LRVs, 2-move THMs, 3-both, (v2.1) 4-No _Proxy name. 0-disable
* **QRDR** Detect QR Codes while recording and during Quik previews. Used for changing a video burn-in message in the middle of a live-stream. This also allows you to end a capture via a QR Code (command: !E).  Input Data: 1-enable, 0-disable
* **RLTC** Read LTC timecode from audio inputsInput Data: 1-Enable, 0-Disable.  e.g. `*RLTC=1`

* **SHMX** H8-9 & MAX: Photo shutter maximum exposure time: this is similar Maximum Shutter Angle (EXPT), except it applies to Photos. e.g. SHMX=1000 would set 1/1000th of a second as the longest shutter time. Input Data: 30-2000.
* **SOLO** H9-13: Use only one channel of audio. e.g. `$SOLO=1` use only channel 1, `$SOLO=4` use only channel 4.Input Data: 0-4, the value is a channel number.
* **SPED** SD Card Speed Test. Data rates should have minimums above 120Mb/s is you want to reliably capture the high bitrate modes.Input Data: 1-9, number of times to run the test.
* **STOP** A Stop Motion extension where is STOP=x the number for frames to store per shutter press. This modify timelapse video. It is recommend to make a stop motion preset with this command `mT$PRES="0,STOP"mTr5Xp4` Works great with the remote. Mode button ends capture. 
* **SYNC** H9-11: GPS time/timecode sync. With a good GPS signal, the camera’s internal clock will be precisely updated to the millisecond. It will not update the hour or date, preserving your current timezone offset. Input Data: 1-enable, 0-disable. Permanent required. e.g. `*SYNC=1`

* **WAKE** H9-13: Conditional wake on any power addition. Inserting a battery or the connection of USB power, will boot up the camera to continue a script after a power failure.  Input Data: 1-wake if there is a delay action pending, 2-wake on power, 0-disable  e.g. `*WAKE=2`
* **WARM** H12-13: offset white balance for the red channel. WARM is good to use with DIVE, so you can improve the red respond for deeper dives. `$WARM=50` will add 50% more gain to the red channel.  
* **WBDV** H13 only: White Balance DiVe improvements. Rather than WARM for improving diving white balance, which effects WB the same at all depths, WBDV is more automatic – as the scene gets more blue, the more the red channel is gained up. Currently $WBDV=1 is uses =2.33,4.0 internally (gaining red 4x after red gain hits 2.33), so you can try tuning this yourself e.g. `$WBDV=2.4,3.0`
* **WBLK** H11-13: White balance Lock upon capture. Allows the convenience of auto white balance, without the risk of WB change during capture. Input Data: 1-enable WB Lock, 0-disable

* **ZONE** H9-13: Set the time zone for use with SYNC. Input Data: time zone offset in minutes.

## Macro support (since March, '24)
Added support for macros, or crude scripting subroutines. This expands the potential complexity for QR scripting, as the entire script is no longer limited to 255 characters. 
It would be possible to run scripts nearing ~1.2KB. Note: recursion is supported, macros can call other macros, and can call themselves.

Macros are saved in string FourCCs:
* **$**fourcc**&#61;<courier>"custom Labs commands"</courier>**  (temporary)
* **\***fourcc**&#61;<courier>"custom Labs commands"</courier>**  (permanent)

Example: This macro calculates the Light Value and stores the result in variable **E**<br>
`LVAL="=Ii=Ss=I/100=S/I=E6.25=E*S=E#2"`

 e.g. `*SUBA="mVr4p60'60p'!S!2E!1N"` Note: Use single quotes for text within double quotes.

In a separate QR Code will call LVAL and display the result<br>
`^LVAL"Current LV $E"`

Note: for Macros that print output use single quotes for text within.
`DPLV="^LVAL'current LV $E'"`

## Reset Actions ##

* `!RESET!1OR` - erase all your permanent metadata (anything that used !Mxxxx command.) Then Reboot. (requires user confirmation.)
* `!FORMAT` <sup>H10-13</sup> for SD formatting via QR Code (requires user confirmation.)
* `!FRESET` <sup>H10-13</sup> Factory reset, erase everything, except QR code metadata (requires user confirmation.)
* `!PRESET` <sup>H10-13</sup> Presets reset, restore the default presets (requires user confirmation.)
* `!WRESET` <sup>H10-13</sup> WiFi Credentials reset, erase all your BLE and WiFi configurations (requires user confirmation.)

## Scripting

The geek factor is highest in this section.  This is close to a Turing-complete language, you can get many interesting capture control jobs done.  There are save and load commands, additive metadata and clock time conditionals

* **!SAVEname=script**  e.g. `!SAVEdaily=dPmP!12:00S!Ldaily` - a save script called ‘daily’ that repeatedly shots one photo every day at noon. 
* **!Lname**  e.g. `!LnightLapse` - load and run a script called nightLapse
* **<courier>"any text"</courier>** e.g. `mV"Video Mode"!S!5E!4NmP"Photo Mode"!S!5R` - this will display <courier>"Video Mode"<courier> and <courier>"Photo Mode"</courier> when switch to those modes.  

### Conditionals Based on Time

**\<** , **>** and **==** characters are used to indicate a conditional: less than, greater than equal, and equal (**==** Since March 2024 firmware)

`<08:45!S` is equivalent to 

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Start

`>18:30!R` is equivalent to 

> if(current_time >= 18:30) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Repeat

`==10:10!R` is equivalent to
> if(current_time == 10:10) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Repeat


The if condition defaults to effecting only the one command after the condition

`<08:45!S"Hello World"` is equivalent to:

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Start<br>
> print <courier>"Hello World"</courier>
	
The start will happen if the condition is true, but the print message occurs whether true or false.  To make the print also part of the true state you can use **+** between the joined commands.

`<08:45!S+"Hello World"` is equivalent to

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Start <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    print <courier>"Hello World"</courier> <br>
> }

These can be stacked too, e.g. `<08:45!S+"Hello World"+!60E` is equivalent to

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Start <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    print <courier>"Hello World"</courier> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    After 60 seconds End the capture <br>
> }

Conditions support **else** statements using the **~** character after the last 'true' command

`<08:45!S+"Hello World"+!60E~!08:44N!R` is equivalent to

> if(current_time < 8:45) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Start <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    print <courier>"Hello World"</courier> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    After 60 seconds End the capture <br>
> }<br>
> else<br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Sleep until 8:44 the next day <br>
> }<br>
> Repeat


Conditionals themselves can be stacked like `>09:15<10:00!S` is equivalent to 

> if(current_time >= 9:15) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(current_time <= 10:00) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start<br>
	
However the else can only be applied to the last condition. `>09:15<10:00!S+"Hello World"+!60E~!09:30N!R` is equivalent to

> if(current_time >= 9:15) <br>
> {<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	if(current_time <= 10:00) <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	{<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Start<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		print <courier>"Hello World"</courier><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		After 60 seconds End the capture<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	else<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	{<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Sleep until 9:30 the next day<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}<br>
> }<br>
> Repeat

The command language is kept simple, so it doesn't maintain a stack on the conditional nesting. 

### Conditionals Based on Camera Status (HERO10 or newer)

Now \>xValue and/or \<xValue and/or ==xValue can be used to test camera states, where 'x' is the camera state to test, and Value the amount to test against:<br>

### Assignments, Variables and Math

QR Command scripts can include variables and operation on them. Why? Fun maybe? More power, for sure! A complete program in a QR Code.

As 'a' to 'z' and system system fields, 'A' to 'Z' are the variable can contain any floating point number. This new variables are all initialized to zero, 
and can be tested with the '<' and '>' conditionals. To make them non-zero, they can be assign with and '=' command. Just like with conditions and action, 
the '=' character is the command delimiter and comes first.  

`=A5`  is the command variable A = 5.

`=P3.14159265` assigns Pi to variable P.  

Now math can be used to modify your variables.

* `=A+1.4` adds in form A = A + 1.4
* `=D-2` subtraction D = D - 2  (note: assignments of negative numbers aren't support, but subtracting is. So `=D0=D-2` would initialize D to be -2, although =D0 is unnecessary as all variable are initialize to zero at boot.)
* `=A*P` multiply A = A * P
* `=E/7` divide E = E &#47; 7
* `=H^A` raised to a power H = H ^ A
* `=F^0.5` raised to a power F = sqrt(F)
* `=B%10` modulus  B = B % 10 
* `=G#2` Log base N  G = log(G)/log(2) 
* `=J&6` Bitwise AND like  J = (float)((int)J & 6) 
* `=K|3` Bitwise OR K = (float)((int)K &#124; 3) 

There should be a prize if some can come up with a practical use for all of these ;)

So if thought the above is crazy, it gets weirder.

* `=B$BITR`  load the contents of the BITR (bitrate) hack into variable B, otherwise store zero.  So you can test if a feature is enabled.
* `=Tt:W` load the day of the week into variable T
* `=Di` load the current ISO value into variable D
* `$EVBS=E`  store the current into EV Bias hack, so you can make a variable mess with your exposure (potentially mid capture.)
* `*VARC=C`  permanently store the current variable C into metadata field VarC, so this can be read back on next boot.  
* `!$AR`  delay an action (like !R) with a variable amount of time, e.g. `=A$VARA<A1=A1=A*2*VARA=A!$AR` this will loop forever, doubling the sleep time with each interation

### Why Add Math to QR codes

You the user can have very particular shooting needs, this improves the robustness of Labs to cover a wider range of automatic captures. And is it cool. ;)

Say you want use a GoPro as a crude light meter, and report the output as an [exposure value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value), then make capture decision based on that EV value.

EV = logbase2 (f-number^2/(time x gain_above_base_iso))  is the formula for EV<br>

As a QR command: `=E6.25=Gi=G*0.01=E/G=E*s=E#2"Exposure value $E"!R`<br>

Command steps explained:
> E=6.25<br>
> G=ISO value<br>
> G=G&#42;0.01<br>
> E=E/G<br>
> E=E&#42;shutter value (1/s)<br>
> E=log(E)/log(2)<br>
> print E<br>
> repeat<br>
