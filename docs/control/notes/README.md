# GoPro Labs Firmware Release Notes 

Only the more recent releases are documented below. This a general list of Labs enhancements on top on the mainline firmware updates. Changes to mainline firmware are not listed.


## HERO13 Black 

### 1.30.70 - November 21, 2024
- Added WBDV - White Balance DiVe improvements. Rather than WARM for improving diving white balance, which effects WB the same at all depths, 
WBDV is more automatic -- as the scene get more blue, the more the red channel is gain up. Currently $WBDV=1 is uses =2.33,4.0 internally 
(gaining red 4x after red gain hits 2.33), so you can try tuning this yourself e.g. $WBDV=2.4,5.0
- Added SHEL - Using $SHEL=1 enables a command shell for Labs over a USB serial port. Every experimental, and looking for feedback. 
Connect to COM at 115200 8N1. All QR code command work, just type them. Used $ commands will report their data back to the shell, 
e.g. $BITR or $A or $p:T to read variables.
- Added OPNW - Open Network (allows of faster non-secure http:// vs https:// to be used with Open GoPro)
- Fixed supporting numbers in FourCC codes in Presets (e.g. preset named "DIVE 24HZ")
- Fixed d1 and d10 for 10-bit selection
- Fixed voice control enabling in Labs

### 1.20.70 - October 25, 2024
- Added *DRFT=1 for automatic clock drift fix.
- Added *DRFS=-11.3 for a fixed clock drift fix.
- Added mPp1 or p.5 for interval photo
- Fix for the TONE extension
- Fix for wake events under power
- Fix for ISO and SHUT LCD overlay position
- Fix for multiple day wake events e.g. !259200N for sleeping for 72 hours
- Fix for the !1R required in motion detection, now !R works again 
- Fix for *SYNC=1 and its impact on timecode

### 1.12.70 - September 24, 2024
- Added command oX10 to select Auto Detect for lens mods.
- Fixed LOGB with offsets less than -100, now LOGB=200,-128 works as intended.
- Fixed crash with creating presets through the menus.  If instability presists, reset the presets.

### 1.10.70 - September 10, 2024
- Added STOP=x for Stop Motion where is x the number for frame to store per shutter press. Works great with the remote. Mode button ends capture.  
- Added ONIO=x Onion percentage used for Stop Motion where is x the precentage of transparency of the onion skin.  
- Added DIST=x Time-Lapse Video Distance, x is a GPS travel distance, rather than time for an in-camera computed timelapse. When x=1 10m will be used.   
- Added DIVE=1 - optimizing the Hypersmooth stabilization for underwater. The water refractive index defaults to 1.335 (good for fresh and command salt water), if you know your area RI is significantly different DIVE=r where r can be 1.3 to 1.45 is supported.
- Added WARM=x and COOL=x to offset white balance.  WARM is good to use with DIVE, so you can improve the red respond for deeper dives. 
- Added RLTC=1 to enable LTC timecode reading from line-in audio 
- Added OLTC=x frame offset to LTC, enabling calibration you are seeing any offset.
- Added MMSK=time, for auto generating a mask for the new motion detector
- Added GOAL=x - 0 to 60 (or x) MPH speed timing. Not for precision timing, just for fun. Drive safe.
- Added GPSL=x to enabled continous GPS location logging, even when not capturing, so the capture can log more of you path and adventures. 
    Path is saved by day into MISC/GPS-yy-mm-dd.gpmf file. GPSL=1 logs everything, GPSL=x will only log movement great than x meter from the last stored location. 
- Added custom Labs setting within Preset names. e.g. ```*DIVE=1*BITR=160``` (standard formatting) or ```DIVE 24HZ``` or ```24HZ,DIVE,NR01``` (space or comma delimited). 
For advanced Labs users, preset names can call macros. Warning: don't put permanent settings or actions with presets, could brick your camera.
  * Safe example: 
  * ```*OVLY="$BURN='(0,20)[BRHH:MM:SSaa mm-dd-yyyy ]'"```   <- Enable overlay macro
  * ```*OVLy="$BURN=''"```   <- Disable overlay macro, required to disable when leaving/deselecting a preset
  * ```$PRES="0,OVLY"``` <- Now this OVLY preset will enable overlays for that preset alone.
  * as one cmd: ```*OVLY="$BURN='(0,20)[BRHH:MM:SSaa mm-dd-yyyy ]'"*OVLy="$BURN=''"$PRES="0,OVLY"```
- Added !A for appending frames for a new controlled video timelapse.  Stop motion, GPS interval Lapse etc.
- Added !C to Clear last GSP distance so command like this are simplier >c10!C+!A!R //(if distance > 10m) Clear()+Append() repeat;

- Improved handling of utf-8 characters in QR Codes.
- Improved long form wake reliability
- Improved archive messages
- Improved AUDS, auto start voice control (required for SPL outside of video recording)

- Added WBLK=1 or wL white balance lock immediately upon capture, allowing auto white balance in dive footage, where good white balance can be tricky.
- Added new condition commands. Previous only >HH:MMcommand or <HH:MMcommand, meaning if(current_time>HH:MM) or if(current_time<HH:MM) respectivily
  Now >x and/or <x can be used to test camera states, where 'x' is the camera state to test:
   * **u** USB stage - >uCmd1~Cmd2 or <uCmd3 expand to if(power is on USB) Cmd1 else Cmd2  or  if(no power on USB) cmd.  e.g. >u"Power On"~"Power Off"
   * **r** recording 
   * **a** accelerationValue - >a100     if(acceleration > V) Cmd1  e.g. >a100"accleration\n>100mg" numbers are in milli-gs (1000 is 1 unit of gravity.) 
   * **d** GPS DOP - <d800 - if(DOP then then 800)
   * **e** random <e50 - 50% true  <e90  - 90% true. 
   * **g** gyroValue - >gValue  if(gryo > Value) Cmd1  e.g. >g15"gyro > 15dps" numbers are in degrees per second.
   * **k** speedValue - if(gps Speed > Value) Cmd1  e.g. >k45"speed > 45km/h" numbers are in km/h.
   * **p** soundpressureValue - in dB
   * **i** isoValue - ISO ranging from 100 to 6400
   * **s** shutterValue - 1/Value for shutter speed
- Added a random delay option 'e' e.g. !eS (start random within an hour) or !e10E (end random within 10 seconds) or !e60N (NOP wait for random up to 60seconds.)
- Added crude super of macro (near focus) lenses, with e.g. oMMACR=-0.1,0.2,... (add the distortion prescription for the added lens.)
- Added oC1 - Auto Off 1 minute  oC0 - Auto Off default length
- Restored 64BT=x where x is the number of MB.
- Enhanced PRXY=4 for DaVinci style proxies.


### 2.00.70 - Jan 5, 2023
